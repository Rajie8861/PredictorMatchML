# PredictorMatchML
This is a small level Python and Machine Learning Project, which essentially takes a csv and uses pandas tool to clean the data. Using the new data we can make a Machine Leanring model using sklearn.metrics which will give accuracy scores of the model. The project will train the model to predict wins for teams.
